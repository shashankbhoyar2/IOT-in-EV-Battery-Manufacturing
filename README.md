# IOT-in-EV-Battery-Manufacturing
As the production line is semi-automated some of the critical stations has to be monitored continuously to increase the efficiency of the line. This can be implemented using IoT in Industry 4.O application.
#About Project:
Create a user-friendly dashboard that measures the manufacturing time for a battery pack and displays the results in real-time. This project will enable users to monitor the duration of the process accurately and efficiently. As the production line is semi-automated some of the critical stations has to be monitored continuously to increase the efficiency of the line. This can be implemented using IoT in Industry 4.O application. The main intention of this project is to count the objects moving on a conveyer belt in industries and to monitor and count the number of objects moving from one end to the other end.
